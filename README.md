Step 1:- Create model for the application  - [x] <br/>
Step 2:- Train, test, validate model - [x]  <br/>
Step 3:- Convert model (with and without quantization) to Flat buffer format - [x]  <br/>
Step 4:- Convert flat buffer to required format (Char array)  - [x]  <br/>
# Step 5:- Port model on ESP32  - [ ]  <br/>
Step 6:- Test quantized and unquantized models for accuracy and memory  - [ ]  <br/>
